# 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string `s`, return _the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of_ `s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aabca"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
\- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
\- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
\- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "adc"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "bbcbaba"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
\- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
\- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
\- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
\- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

# My solution

## Intuition

If its a palindrome it begins and ends with the same character. Meaning if you find the first and last instance of that char, every unique char inbetween is a unique palindrome.

Repeat this for every letter of the alphabet and you'll get every unique palindrome.

## Approach

1.  Create a count for the number of palindromes
2.  Loop over every letter of the alphabet
3.  Check if 2 or more instances of that char (necessary for palindrome)
4.  Get min & max index of char instances
5.  Create a sub string of these chars
6.  Add these chars to a set
7.  Add the set size to the output count

## Complexity 

*   Time complexity: O(n)

## Code
```javascript
    /**
     * @param {string} s
     * @return {number}
     */
    var countPalindromicSubsequence = function (s) {
        let output = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            let chr = String.fromCharCode(97 + i)
            if ((s.match(new RegExp(chr, "g")) || []).length >= 2) {
                let minIdx = s.indexOf(chr) + 1
                let maxIdx = s.lastIndexOf(chr)
                const subStr = s.substring(minIdx, maxIdx)
                const subStrSet = new Set(subStr.split(""))
                output += subStrSet.size
            }
        }
        return output;
    };
```
